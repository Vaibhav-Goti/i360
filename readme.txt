==============================================
The EOS Utility supports the following image file formats.

2. Notes on connecting to Canon Cameras
=========================================
(1) Do not unplug the memory card or battery, or disconnect the communication
cable, during transmission of data between the EOS Utility and Canon digital
camera, as this may lead to malfunction depending on the computer you are using.

(2) Do not put the computer into Standby mode while the Canon camera is
connected to the computer's USB port. If the computer does
somehow enter Standby mode while the Canon camera is connected to the computer's
USB port, be sure to recover from Standby mode without
disconnecting the cable from the computer. If the cable is disconnected during
Standby mode, it may not be possible to recover from Standby mode depending on
the computer model. For more details on Standby mode, please refer to the
Operation Manual for your computer.

(3) The camera cannot communicate with multiple instances of software.
Be sure that there is only one piece of software running during data transfer
with the camera.


3. Notes on loading images
============================
(1) When loading images onto your computer using the EOS Utility, be sure
to check beforehand that there is enough storage space on the disk or hard
drive being saved to. If you attempt to load images without sufficient
storage to save them, transfer of images may be halted midway and images
may not be loaded properly.

(2) Do not operate the camera during interval timer shooting.



4. Notes on Fast User Switching in Windows
==============================================
Do not use fast user switching while using the EOS Utility.

5. Notes on movie recording
=============================
The recording time shown in the Remote Live View window may not match 
the recording time displayed on the camera LCD monitor. 
The actual recording time is the time displayed on the camera LCD monitor.
